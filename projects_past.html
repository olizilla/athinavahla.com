Infecting the City Festival, Church Square, Cape Town, South Africa 
			</b></p>
			<p><b>
13 to 20 February 2010			
			</b></p>
			<p><a href="http://www.infectingthecity.com/2010/whats-on/productions/meet-market/">
			www.infectingthecity.com
			</a></p>
			<p>		
Athina has been selected to take part in an eight week creative residency in Cape Town to collaborate with performance makers from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Australia and the Netherlands to make a brand new site-specific work for Infecting the City festival. 
			</p>
			<p>
A week-long festival of outdoor work taking place all over Cape Town, this year’s Infecting the City takes the theme of Human Rites. 
			</p>
			<p>
On the Square that was once home to the ritual of slavery, a new rite is exercised. An infected wound is lanced, disinfected and then sealed to allow healing. 			
			</p>
			<p>
The procedure is not pretty; it concerns dis-ease. The active disinfecting agent is a radical swing between the opposing dynamics of the violent and the funny, the extraordinary and the mundane. Stillness in the midst of vigorous movement. The putrefaction of centuries of denial and shame requires removal. It is painful and yet, strangely, it provokes laughter: both are necessary for complete healing.			
			</p>
			<p>
Summoning the conflicting memories and the fragmented histories of the people of Cape Town to Church Square, this ritual weaves one story from many truths.			
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>		
For Homelands Dance Festival, Athina will be working with a dancer (Leon Baugh), a dance scientist (Emma Redding), a film-maker (Monica Alcazar) and a photographer (Helen Burrows) alongside a boxer and his trainer from Repton Boys Boxing Club in Bethnal Green to investigate boxing training, structures and rituals.
			</p>
			<p>
The creative team will work together over two weeks in a short, risk-taking process that will look at transforming elements of boxing training into performative action and touch upon state of mind in both training and contest. On Sunday 8th November, they will show and discuss their work to date at Chisenhale Dance Space. This is the second phase of research and development towards the <span class="title">Arenas</span> project.
			</p>
			<p>
The photographs by Helen Burrows are part of her current project <span class="title">No Guts No Glory</span> at Repton Boys Boxing Club.

			<h2 id="ListeningPost">Listening Post (2008)</h2>
			<p>		
Athina was Dancer in Residence at the Science Museum, London from May to October 2008. The focus of the residency was a performed response to <span class="title">The Listening Post</span>, a ‘dynamic portrait’ of online communication by artists Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin that displays uncensored fragments of text sampled in real-time from internet chat-rooms and bulletin boards. Stray thoughts resonate through the space in sound and voice as texts surge, flicker, appear and disappear across a suspended grid of over 200 electronic screens. 
			</p>
			<p>
Athina’s response was a series of movement vignettes repeated in a cyclical pattern. Through the live presence of the dancers, she tried to locate a sense of humanity in the symphony of disembodied voices and texts and to reflect the contrasts between communication and isolation, utterance and silence, the passing and the permanent, sender and receiver, and the fleeting moment of a thought upon a screen.

			<p>
Objects of Friction and Fact, draws its inspiration from Kurt Vonnegut’s book A Man Without A Country. Using the mythological element of the triad and constructing a fictional, hermetic world, it attempts to voice an objection to the present state of “civilisation”.

			<h2 >Spaces Between (2007)</h2>
			<p>
A site-specific work for the foyers and public spaces to celebrate the re-opening of the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre. Athina worked with dramaturg Pete Brooks to create a large-scale work that took as its starting point the Festival of Britain in 1951 and traced post war British society to the present day.  
			</p>
			<p>
The six floors of the Royal Festival Hall became the decks of a ghost ship journeying along the Thames bringing the past to the present and anticipating a future that is about to unfold. Athina collaborated  with Candoco Dance Company, Central St Martin’s School of Art and Design, Newham Sixth Form College and Guildhall School of Music to create a promenade performance incorporating seven simultaneous journeys with a cast of 150 performers and an audience of 1000 for each performance.

			<h2 id="InPraiseofFolly">In Praise of Folly (2006)</h2>
			<p>
			A rich and evocative piece of dance theatre inspired by the intrigues of Renaissance art. <span class="title">In Praise of Folly</span> is pervaded by a powerful sense of beauty coupled with a constant potential for destruction. The work draws its theme from Erasmus’s In Praise of Folly, a satire based on the religious and political state of Renaissance Italy.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="title">In Praise of Folly</span> was developed from <span class="title">Memento Mori</span> a site-specific project created in 2005 for Candoco Dance Company and Greenwich Dance Agency and influenced by research in Italy on Western religious iconography. Athina’s journey was supported by Candoco and guided by curators from the National Gallery and the Courtauld Institute.

An interpretation of the Spanish bullfight and its rituals made for Transitions Dance Company. The bullring is used as an arena for human relationships which conjures feelings of suffocation and renders desire futile. The bullfighter and the bull become man and his shadow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="quote">“I was stunned by the vigour and rough violence of Vahla’s take on the Spanish bull-ring. Tall figures sharpening knives made a memorable image to open a series of sinister interactions which ‘render human desire futile’. The music by Vivaldi, Cave and one of Schubert’s most moving songs contributed to a satisfying whole.”</span>

			A two-part, site-specific work for the Herb Garret and Old Operating Theatre at St Thomas’s Hospital and a vast disused abattoir in Clerkenwell that took the audience on a physical and emotional journey through the complex landscape of the human body and mind in settings of surgery and slaughter.
			</p>
			<p>
The Old Operating Theatre presents the spectator with the scientific notion of order where the body is dissected to find the mind. In the labyrinthine compartments of the vast abattoir, order breaks down and the journey is haunted by fragmented memory.

				<span class="quote">“Vahla’s version departs from the literal content of the source but, as in Beckett, she wants to use the performer as a vessel pouring out strange contents… Sonia Rafferty is a precise mirror of an interior horror, a human machine that obeys an exterior motor while keeping a frightful and rebellious eye on the unfriendly takeover. Her struggle, accompanied by violent mechanical sound, is hypnotic. The long, concentrated process of interiorising rather than mimicking the colonisation of Rafferty’s body is painfully visible.”</span>
